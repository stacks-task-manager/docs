# Stack

The **Stack** represents a collection of tasks in a specific order, either manual or automatic based on sorting setting. A stack can also be called a `Task List` (when in the [List View](./list-view.md)) or `Column` (when in the [Board view](./board-view.md)) .

## Sorting Tasks

By default the tasks are manually sorted (by dragging and dropping in [Board View](./board-view.md) and [List View](./list-view.md)), but you can also enable automatic task sorting from the Stack menu:

<p align="center">
<img :src="$withBase('/assets/img/projects/stack-sorting.png')" width="50%"> 
</p>

1. Click on the menu button to open the Stack menu popup
2. Select a sorting type and direction under the **Order tasks** menu
3. Select an automatic sorting order

::: tip
By selecting the **Manual** drag-and-drop sorting will be re-enable

## Tint
