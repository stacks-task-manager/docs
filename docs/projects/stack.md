# Stack

The **Stack** represents a collection of tasks in a specific order, either manual or automatic based on sorting setting. A stack can also be called a "*Task List*" mostly when using the [List View](./list-view.md).

## Sorting Tasks

By default the tasks are manually sorted (by dragging and dropping in [Board View](./board-view.md) and [List View](./list-view.md)), but you can also enable automatic task sorting from the Stack menu:

1. click on the menu button [<svg width="12px" height="12px" viewBox="0 0 5 19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle cx="2.5" cy="2.5" r="2.5"></circle><circle cx="2.5" cy="16.5" r="2.5"></circle><circle cx="2.5" cy="9.5" r="2.5"></circle></svg>] to open the Stack menu popup
2. select a sorting type and direction under the **Order tasks** menu
