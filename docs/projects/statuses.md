# Statuses

Just like [Tags](./tags.md) statuses are another way of organizing your tasks. Unlike tags the statuses are mapped 1 to 1 with the task. The status can be created either as a **workspace status** (global - visible accross the whole workspace), or **local status** (only visible on the current project).

The statuses are mostly used to indicate how a tasks iss progressing: `On track`, `Off track`, `Progressing`, and so on.

    2. start typing the new status name
    3. select a color from the predefined list and click the **Create new status** button
2. from the project preferences
