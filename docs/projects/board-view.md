# Board view

The board view uses a kanban board. A kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). It can help both agile and DevOps teams establish order in their daily work. Kanban boards use cards ([Tasks](./task.md)), columns ([Stacks](./stack.md)).
