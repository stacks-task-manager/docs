# Time view

The Time view is an essential feature that can help customers keep track of the time spent on various tasks in a project. This view provides a comprehensive table view of all the logged time across all tasks, which can help customers get a summary and totals of billable and non-billable hours, as well as totals logged by assignees.

With filters to query specific tasks and dates, customers can easily monitor the progress of their projects and ensure that they are on track. Whether you are a project manager or a team member, the Time view is a valuable tool that can help you stay organized and efficient.
