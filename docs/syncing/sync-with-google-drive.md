# Sync with Google Drive

To sync Stacks data with Google Drive service, first you need to download Google Drive App from here [https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB/drive/download/](https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB/drive/download/).

After you've have configured Google drive folder on your device, assuming you currently have **Stacks** file saved on a local folder, you just need to move your current Workplace folder from the local folder to a Google Drive folder following the [Moving a workspace](../workspaces/moving-a-workspace.md) guide.

After the files have been synced, to access the workspace in the other pc/mac you just need to install Stacks and follow the guide to add a new workspace, [Adding a new workspace](../workspaces/add-new-workspace.md) locating the Google Drive folder you have just synced.
