# Sync with Dropbox

To sync Stacks data with Dropbox service, first you need to download Dropbox from here [https://www.dropbox.com/downloading](https://www.dropbox.com/downloading)

After you've have configured Dropbox folder on your device, assuming you currently have Stacks file saved on a local folder, you just need to move your current Workplace folder from the local folder to a Dropbox folder following the [Moving a workspace](../workspaces/moving-a-workspace.md) guide.

After the files have been synced, to access the workspace in the other pc/mac you just need to install Stacks and follow the guide to [Adding a new workspace](../workspaces/add-new-workspace.md), Adding a new workspace locating the Dropbox folder you have just synced.
