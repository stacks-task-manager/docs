# User roles

Roles are a way to grant users different permission when viewing the data.

## Admin

The `admin` role is the highest role a user can have. Having this role will bypass any restricton and privacy options set to any resource. Basically the admin can change and view anything that's hidden from all the other roles.

Admins also have the option to reset a users password and change roles.

## Manager

The `manager` role is a step below the admin. This role has one advantage over the `user` and that's the ability to view everyones logged time.

## User

The `user` role is the basic user that's using the Stacks app. He/She can create any resource and manage the privacy options only for resources own by him/her.

## Collaborator

The `collaborator` is just a regular user but grouped in a separate role. This will allow `admin`'s and `manager`'s to create different visibility/privacy options for them.

This role is mainly used for people outside of the company that can log in and view certain tasks.

## Client

The `client` is just a regular user but grouped in a separate role. This will allow `admin`'s and `manager`'s to create different visibility/privacy options for them.

This role is mainly used for customer that can log in and view certain tasks.

## Contact

The `contact` role is just a plain user which does not have the ability log in. It is mainly created to store any contact information of this person.
