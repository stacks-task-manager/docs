# Layout

**Stacks** has a three-column interface. The first column displays the list of configured [Workspaces](../workspaces/what-is-a-workspace.md)[`1`]. The second column displays the [Sidebar](./sidebar.md)[`2`] containing all the [Documents](./documents.md) organized in folders. And the third column is the main app area, where you can view your [projects](../projects/README.md)[`3`], contacts, notepads and more.
