## Filtering

The calendar has a filter which is accessible from the top toolbar. The filter lets you toggle the visibility of:

- events
- tasks
- birthdays
- time logs

## Adding an event

There are 2 main ways of adding a new event:

1. using the mouse and draging/selecting a specific time span (squares)
2. from the top toolbar by clicking the `Add event` button

## Editing an event

The events can be easily changed by either dragging/dropping or resizing them to a different time span, or by double clicking on them and use the modal window to change both the title and dates.
