# Home

The home is the best place to start your day when running Stacks. It allow you to have a bird's-eye view of your current work, favorite projects and people, to do list, personal notes and more.

Home will show the following info:

- Favorite projects
- My tasks either for `today` or `this week` based on `start`, `do` or `due` dates
- Private to do list
- Pinned bookmarks
- Favorite people and companies
- Private notes
