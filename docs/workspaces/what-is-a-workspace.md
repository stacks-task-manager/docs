# What is a workspace?

A workspace contains folders, projects, notepads, and people lists.

There are two types of workspaces:

## Local workspace
The **local workspace** that you can use for your personal project and you can save the data on a local folder or any cloud syncing service of your choice (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud drive).

Check out how to sync your local workspace here.

## Online workspace
The **online workspace** requires a server which is handling all the data syncing for you. This option is usefull when there are many parties working on the same document at the same time.
